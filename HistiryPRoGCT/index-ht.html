<h2>Biography:</h2>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

<ul style="font-size: 18px">
  <li>An Ionian of deep resolve, <strong>Yasuo</strong> is an agile swordsman,
     trained to wield the air itself against his enemies. As a young man, pride
     led him down a path of loss, costing him his position, his mentor, and ultimately
     his own brother. Disgraced by false accusations and now hunted as little more
     than a criminal, <strong>Yasuo</strong> wanders his homeland seeking redemption for his past,
      with only the wind to guide his blade.</li>
    <li>For a long time, I chose to run, for death followed
      at my back. The people hunting me once called me their friend. Now,
      when they draw their blades, they call me 'murderer'.</li>
    <li>The first was a swordsman of strength
      renowned throughout Ionia. When we were young, I saw him
      cleave a tree in two with a single swing of his blade.</li>
    <li>The second was a warrior of speed and grace. Agile and
      cunning, she outran the clever foxes in the woods.</li>
      <li>The third was a man of compassion. He taught me the meaning of patience
        when I was just a prideful child.</li>
      <li>How long can I keep going? Even the strongest wind eventually dies.</li>
  </ul>
